	<p class="heading-text3_em"><b>Section B</b>, Answer any three questions (3 x 8 = 24 Marks) </p>
      
       <ol class="heading-text2_em">
	<li>Four forces of 35 N, 30 N, 25 N and 20 N are acting simultaneously along straight lines OA, OB, OC and OD such that ∠ AOB = 50°; ∠ BOC = 100° and ∠ COD = 125°. Find the magnitude and direction of the resultant force. Show also the force diagram.</li>
	<li>A tri-wheel power tiller weighing 5 kN has a small wheel symmetrically placed 500 mm in front of two large wheels which are placed 400 mm apart. If centre of gravity of the power tiller be at a horizontal distance of 150 mm from the rear wheels and that of the rider whose weight is 600 N, be 100 mm from the rear wheels. Find the thrust on the ground under different wheels. Also, show the forces in a diagram.</li>
	<li>A right circular solid cylinder of 12 cm diameter is joined with a solid hemisphere of the same diameter face to face. Find the greatest height of the cylinder, so that centre of gravity of the composite section coincides with the plane of joining the two sections. The density of the material of hemisphere is twice that the material of cylinder.</li>
	<li>Find the moment of inertia of a T-section with flange as 150 mm × 50 mm and web as 180 mm × 50 mm about X-X and Y-Y axes passing through the Centre of gravity of the section.</li>
	<li>An effort of 200 N is required just to move a certain body up an inclined plane of angle 15° the force acting parallel to the plane. If the angle of inclination of the plane is made 20° the effort required, again applied parallel to the plane, is found to be 230 N. Find the weight of the body and the coefficient of friction.</li>
