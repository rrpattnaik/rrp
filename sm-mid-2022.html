	<p class="heading-text3_em"><b>Section B</b>, Answer any three questions (3 x 8 = 24 Marks) </p>
      
       <ol class="heading-text2_em">
	<li>A core cutter for in-situ unit weight measurement of embankment is 12.5 cm in height and 10.1 cm in diameter weighs 1075 g when empty. The weight of core cutter full of undisturbed soil is 2975 g. The specific gravity of the soil is 2.6. Answer the followings
	(i) If the water content is 8%, what are in-situ dry density, dry unit weight and the void ratio of the soil? 
	(ii) if the embankment gets fully saturated due to heavy rains what will be the increase in water content and bulk unit weight, no volume change occurs in the soil?</li>
	<li>The plastic limit and liquid limit of a soil are 30% and 45% respectively. The percentage volume change from the liquid limit to dry state is 40% of the dry volume. Similarly, the percentage volume change from the plastic limit to the dry state is 20% of the dry volume. Determine the shrinkage limit and the shrinkage ratio. Also, show the diagram water content vs volume change. </li>
	<li>A granular soil deposit is 9 m deep over an impermeable layer. The ground water table is 4 m below the ground surface. The deposit has a zone of capillary rise of 1.0 m with 50% saturation and dry up to the ground surface. Show in a diagram the variation of total stress, pore water pressure and effective stress with the depth of deposit. Take e = 0.6 and G = 2.6. </li>
        <li>A rectangular area 4 m x 5 m carries a uniform load of 100 kN/m<sup>2</sup> at the ground surface.  Find the vertical pressures at 6 m below the center and corner of the loaded area.  Use the equivalent load method. Show the loading and radial distance diagram for both the cases.</li>
	<li>Two identical soil specimen were tested in a triaxial apparatus. First specimen failed at a deviator stress of 800 kN/m<sup>2</sup> when the cell pressure was 200 kN/m<sup>2</sup>. Second specimen failed at a deviater stress of 1500 kN/m<sup>2</sup> under a cell pressure of 500 kN/m<sup>2</sup>. Determine the value of c and φ. Show the loading diagram with stresses on the failure plane.</li>
